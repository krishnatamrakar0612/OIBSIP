# 🎮 Task 2 — Number Guessing Game  
### 🚀 Oasis Infobyte Internship — Java Development Track  

This is **Task 2** of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship**.  
It’s a fun console-based **Number Guessing Game** written in Java.  
The player tries to guess a number randomly chosen by the computer,  
and the program provides hints such as *Too High* or *Too Low* until the correct number is guessed.

---

## 🧠 How the Game Works
1. The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. The user enters guesses through the console.  
3. The computer tells whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number.  
4. The player has a limited number of attempts (default = 10).  
5. The score depends on how quickly the player guesses the number.  
6. The game can be replayed multiple times.
